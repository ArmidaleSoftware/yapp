Yapp-3.0.12 (c)1996 Armidale Software

NOTE: A preliminary draft of the Administration Guide can be found in
      admin_guide.ps.  This guide covers Installation in more detail than
      this file does.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING YAPP 3.0:

1) Decide on what login to use to own Yapp files.  Typically, a separate
   account, is created to own the bbs files.  We will refer to this
   account as `cfadm'.  Access to this account is needed for a Yapp 
   administrator to create and delete new conferences.  We will refer to 
   anyone with access to the cfadm account as the "Yapp administrator".

2) Log in as cfadm, and uncompress and untar the generic distribution and 
   the binary distribution in the destination directory (e.g. /usr/bbs).  
   We will herafter refer to this directory as `bbsdir'.

   For example:
   $ cd /usr/bbs
   $ gunzip yapp.3.0.12-generic-dist.tar.gz
   $ tar -xvf yapp.3.0.12-generic-dist.tar
   $ gunzip yapp3.0.12-solaris-bin.tar.gz
   $ tar -xvf yapp3.0.12-solaris-bin.tar

3) While still logged in as cfadm, run the Install script from the `bbsdir' 
   directory.  This will prompt you for a number of items and may give you
   additional information about what needs to be done.  The default
   value will be shown in square brackets.  If you wish to use the
   defaults shown, you may simply hit enter at the prompts.
      
   For example:
   $ ./Install

   Once you have answered the questions, the Install script will
   attempt to install the options you have requested.  Afterwards, it
   will report any outstanding installation steps which must be performed
   by root.

4) Add an html directory alias, so that /yapp-bin/ points to
   `bbsdir'/www/cgi-bin/    (replacing `bbsdir' with the base directory)
   and /yapp-icons/ points to `bbsdir'/www/gifs/.

   Example for NCSA or Apache httpd's srm.conf:

      ScriptAlias /yapp-bin/ /usr/bbs/www/cgi-bin/
      Alias /yapp-icons/ /usr/bbs/www/gifs/

5) From whatever web page you wish to point to your Yapp BBS, you
   should add a link to /yapp-bin/restricted/main.   If you wish
   to allow users to browse selected conferences (marked as "readonly")
   without authenticating, you should add a link to /yapp-bin/public/list.
   Finally, you should add a link to /yapp-bin/public/newuser if you wish
   for users to be able to create new Yapp accounts.

   Example HTML excerpt:

   <ul>
   <li><A HREF="/yapp-bin/public/newuser">Register as a new user</A><P>
   <li><A HREF="/yapp-bin/restricted/main">Log in as an existing user</A><P>
   <li><A HREF="/yapp-bin/public/list">View read-only conferences</A>
   </ul><P>

6) If you want to use conferences linked to a mailing list (see the
   Administration Guide for more information), you should create a cflink 
   mail alias by adding the following line to /etc/aliases:
   
   cflink:"|/usr/local/bin/bbs -i"

   Then to activate the new alias do:
   $ newaliases

7) [Solaris only]  When a script's shell is a setuid program, Solaris
   doesn't do the setuid.  This is a problem for Yapp scripts, since
   Yapp must run setuid cfadm.  A workaround is to make all Yapp scripts
   in www/cgi-bin/public and www/cgi-bin/restricted setuid cfadm.

8) If the sysop and cfadm logins are different, you should immediately go 
   through the newuser process (at http://localhost/yapp-bin/public/newuser) 
   and create the sysop web account.  This login will be able to access 
   administration functions from the WWW.

9) Once you have Yapp working, you may wish to customize the various
   screens yourself.  Customization is covered in detail in the Administration
   Guide.
