Syntax: edit <#>

Description:
   This will allow (only) the author of a response to edit a previous
   response.  If the new text is less than 78 characters longer than
   the original text, the new text will replace the old text.  Otherwise,
   the old response will be scribbled, and the new text will be entered
   as a new response.  In either case, the old text is logged to a file
   which is readable only by a system administrator.
