Syntax: scr_ibble <#>

Description:
   This will mark a response as censored, and "scribble" over the text so 
   that the text cannot be read at all.  Anyone with the 'scribbler' flag 
   set will be able to see who scribbled over the text.  All scribbled text 
   is logged to a file which can only be read by a system administrator.

   You must be the author of a response, or a fair-witness of a conference
   in order to scribble a response.
