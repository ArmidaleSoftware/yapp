Syntax: re_spond [<#>]
        ps_eudonym [<#>]

Description: Enter a response to the current item.  If the edalways flag 
   is set, the editor will be immediately invoked.  Otherwise, Yapp will 
   collect text.  The pseudonym command will prompt for a full name to 
   enter the response as.

   If an optional response number is given as an argument, the new text
   will be treated as a response to that response number.
