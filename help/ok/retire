Syntax: retire <range>

Description: This will mark items in the specified range as retired.
   Retired items are inaccessible unless unretired.  You may not do 
   this unless either:
      a) You are a fair-witness of the conference
      b) You are the original author of the item and there are no
         responses
   The retire command can be reversed with the unretire command.  Note
   that this does not actually delete the item, as the kill command 
   does.  Retire commands are logged to the conference log file.
