Topic: Conference Security Types

Description: Each conference has an integer security type.  This is
   kept in the config file for a conference, and can only be changed
   by a Yapp administrator (not fairwitnesses).

   Type       Code   Description
   PUBLIC       0    Anyone may participate
   PRESELECT    4    Access restricted to user list (in 'ulist' file)
   PASSWORD     5    Access requires password (in 'secret' file)
   PARANOID     6    Use both a user list and a password together
   PROTECTED    8    Anyone may participate, but items are mode 600
   READONLY    20    Anyone not in ulist may observe
   READPASS    21    Anyone who fails the password check may observe
   READPARA    22    Anyone who fails either check may observe
   MAILLIST    #+64  Mailing list conference (usually code 64)
   REGISTERED  #+128 Registered mailing list conference (usually code 200)
   NOENTER     #+256 Only fairwitnesses may enter new items

   The security type can be set either numerically or as a combination
   of keywords.  Keywords are:

   public       0
   ulist        4
   password     5
   protected    8
   readonly    16
   maillist    64
   registered 128
   noenter    256

   A "registered" maillist conference is one in which only mail from
   registered users gets posted to the conference.  If the sender's
   email address does not match the email address of some user known
   to Yapp, the email is silently dropped.

   Access to a conference can also be restricted to a list of
   host names, domain names, IP addresses, or address prefixes 
   specified in the 'originlist' file.

   NOTE: only the MAILLIST and REGISTERED flags are significant when 
   a conference acl file exists.  The others are obsoleted by the acl 
   system ("help file acl").
