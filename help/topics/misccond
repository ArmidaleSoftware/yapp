Topic: Miscellaneous Conditionals

Description: Miscellaneous conditionals apply in all cases for all separator
   variables.  For any codes which use a number, the number defaults to 0
   unless otherwise stated.  Codes inside conditionals are used only if
   the condition is true.  A code is specified with: %(!#X 
      where ! is an optional '!' or '~' meaning to negate the condition
            # is an optional number
            X is some character below.

   S     true if the user is a fairwitness in the current conference
