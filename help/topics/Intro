Conferences:
   The Yapp conferencing system is composed of a set of "conferences", each
   devoted to some general topic such as sports or computer games.
   Conferences are referenced by their name, and can only be created by
   a system administrator.  Users who have administrative control over a
   specific conference are called "fairwitnesses".

Items:
   Within each conference, a series of "items" can exist, each devoted to
   some specific subject, such as "Detroit Tigers".  Items are usually
   referenced by a number, and can be created by users.

Responses:
   Each item consists of a message followed by zero or more "responses"
   to the original message.  Responses are also referenced by a number,
   and can be entered by any user.
