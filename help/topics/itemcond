Topic: Item Conditionals

Description: Item conditionals apply only to item separator
   variables.  For any codes which use a number, the number defaults to 0
   unless otherwise stated.  Codes inside conditionals are used only if
   the condition is true.  A code is specified with: %(!#X 
      where ! is an optional '!' or '~' meaning to negate the condition
            # is an optional number
            X is some character below.
