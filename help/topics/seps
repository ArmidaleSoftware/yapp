Description: Separator strings are a way of customizing output.  Separator
   strings are saved in variables, each of which has a default value.  There
   are six types of separator codes:

      miscsep  - value applies in all cases
      confsep  - value applies to conference information only
      itemsep  - value applies to item information only

      misccond - condition works in all cases
      confcond - condition works for conference information only
      itemcond - condition works for item information only

   In general, each separator code is of the form: %#X
   where # is an optional number or 'z' or '^'
     and X is some character

   Some exceptions are:
      %<var>     means expand entire variable here (the <> are literals) and
                 capitalize it if ^ was specified
      %{var}     means expand entire variable here (the {} are literals) and
                 capitalize it if ^ was specified
      ${var}     means expand variable here without re-expanding recursively 
                 and capitalize it if ^ was specified
      %(X ... %) means expand ... only if X condition holds (note that
                 %E in ... functions as an ELSE clause)
      %((icon op icon) ... %)  means expand ... only if the given condition
                 holds.  See syntax for the if command for more information.
      %`command` means replace with output of the given command
