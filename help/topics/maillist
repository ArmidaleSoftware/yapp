Topic: Mailing List Conferences

Description: 
   If the conference type has the maillist flag set (see "help security"), 
   then the conference is linked to a mailing list.  Usually, this is
   is a two-way link so that mail to the list appears in the conference
   and responses in the conference are posted to the list.

   The mailing list address used to post responses is specified on
   line 6 of the conference config file.  

   A special maillist file in the main bbs data directory specifies
   which incoming mail addresses go to which conference.  (This is
   because multiple incoming addresses may actually be the same list.)

   In order for your mailer to pass responses to the bbs, it needs
   to be able to invoke "bbs -i" with the email text as input.  The
   simplest way to do this is to add an email alias to /etc/aliases
   of the form:

      cflink: "|/usr/local/bin/bbs -i"

   The address cflink@your.host.name can then be added to the mailing
   lists you wish to link to Yapp conferences.

   Another method is to put:

      "| /usr/local/bin/bbs -i"

   (including the quotes, and the correct pathname) into the .forward
   file of a SINGLE recipient of the email.  This recipient will then
   never see email, so a special login should be used.  The UID of 
   this login must be 0, 1, or the same as the UID which owns Yapp.
