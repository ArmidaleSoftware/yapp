Description: The conference rc file should contain commands that will be
   executed by everyone when the conference is entered.  (This can be
   suppressed by a user with "set nosource".)   In general, these are
   to define conference aliases and customized output.

Example:
define prompt "\nWelcome to August: "
define ag_enda 9 "display index"
define info 9 "unix 'more /m/thaler/info'"
