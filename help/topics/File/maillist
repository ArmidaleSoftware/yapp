Description: This file contains an index of all mailing list addresses
   and associated conference names.
   The first line should be the string "!<hl01>".
   The second line should contain the directory of the default conference
   which, if it matches a conference name, will collect mail which doesn't
   match anything else.  If it isn't a conference name, excess mail will
   be lost.
   The remaining lines should consist of an email address, a colon, and 
   a conference name.
   A conference may have multiple entries with the same directory in 
   order to send multiple addresses to the same conference.

Example:
!<hl01>
