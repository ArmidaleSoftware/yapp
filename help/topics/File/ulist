Description: For private conferences which have a fixed user list,
   this list should be created and maintained by a fair-witness.
   For public conferences, this file is automatically maintained by
   YAPP.  It contains a list of fields separated by whitespace (spaces, 
   tabs, or newlines).  Any lines beginning with a "#" character are 
   interpreted as comments, and ignored.

   Each field may be any of the following:
      login of participant
      UID of participant
      filename of another ulist file to include (same format)
