Description: A conference participation file contains information such 
   as the status of items you have seen.  This is automatically
   maintained by YAPP and modifying it is not recommended.  However, 
   for informational purposes, the format is explained below.

   The first line always contains the magic string "!<pr03>".
   The second line contains the your full name in this conference.
   Following that is one line per item in the conference, with three 
   fields per line.  
   The first field is the item number.
   The second field is how many responses (including #0) you have
   read in that item.  If this is negative, the item is forgotten.
   The third field is the timestamp (in hex) of when you last accessed
   the item.

   An "unseen" item is one with 0 responses read, and a new timestamp
   in your participation file.
   A "brandnew" item is one which has a 0 timestamp in your participation 
   file.
   A "newresponse" item is one which has a positive timestamp in your
   participation file, but less than the timestamp on the actual item.

Example:
!<pr03>
