Description: This file is used for conferences in which partipation
   is restricted to users on machines in a particular domain or
   IP address prefix.  It contains a list of hostnames, domain names,
   IP addresses and/or subnet prefixes separated by whitespace (spaces, 
   tabs, or newlines).  Any lines beginning with a "#" character are 
   interpreted as comments, and ignored.  For a Unix or web user to be
   allowed to join the conference, their host must match one of the
   hostnames, 

Examples:
   ann-arbor.mi.us    allows any hostname equal to or ending with
                      "ann-arbor.mi.us"
   141.211.39.193     allows the indicated IP address
   141.211.39         allows any IP address starting with "141.211.39"
   141.211.38/23      allows any IP address in the indicated subnet
                      range (i.e. any address whose high 23 bits match
                      141.211.38)
