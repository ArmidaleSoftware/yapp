Description: If a .cfonce file exists, the commands therein will
   be executed by the user when YAPP is invoked.  Any variables or
   aliases defined may not be overridden by the YAPP global rc
   or conference rc files.  This is commonly used to force certain
   settings which you do not want changed and to define your own
   global aliases.

Example:
define pager /usr/bin/more
define z 1 "unix 'touch /m/thaler/.cfdir/.cflist' ; next"
set scribbler verbose stay
