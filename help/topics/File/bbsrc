Description: The Yapp rc file should contain commands that will be
   executed by everyone when Yapp is started.  In general, these are
   to define global aliases, customize output, and configure logging.

   The rc file should contain one "log" command for each loggable
   event (see "help log").

Example:
def editor 258 vi
def pager more
def who       9   'unix who'
def write     9   'unix "/usr/local/bin/write"'
def talk      9   'unix "/usr/bin/talk"'
def dir_ectory 9 'unix "/bin/ls"'
def type  9 'unix "/bin/cat"'
def pwd   9 'unix "/bin/pwd"'
def chat  9 'unix "/usr/local/bin/write"'
def shell 9 'unix "/bin/csh"'
def noconfp "\nWelcome to M-Net.\nType HELP CONFERENCES for a list of conferences.\nType JOIN <NAME> to access a conference.\n\n> %c"
log join  '' ''
log leave '' ''
(etc.)
