Description: This file contains an index of all conference names and
   directories.  The first line should be the string "!<hl01>".
   The second line should contain the directory of the default conference.
   The remaining lines should consist of a name, a colon, and a directory.
   The name may have an _ embedded to denote the minimal abbreviation.
   A conference may have multiple entries with the same directory in 
   order to give multiple names to the same conference.
   If the last line is of the form "=filename" then the list is continued
   in another filename, which follows the same format except there should
   be no default directory line.

Example:
!<hl01>
/usr/bbs/confs/august
jul_y:/usr/bbs/confs/jul
aug_ust:/usr/bbs/confs/august
newgen_eral:/usr/bbs/confs/august
