Description: This file can be edited by a fairwitness (with "change
   observers"), and may be used to contain a list of users, specified
   by either login or UID, and separated by whitespace.  In addition,
   a field may be the full pathname of another file to include
   (which has the same format).

   The observers file can then be referenced in the acl file to allow (for 
   example) preventing the indicated users from responding in the conference.
