   maintained by YAPP, and modifying them is not recommended.

   below.

   The first line contains the magic string "!<ps02>".
   The second line contains the item subject prefixed with ",H".
   Following that are a series of responses (including response 0)
   having the following format:

   ,R####
   ,U****,login
   ,Afullname
   ,DXXXXXXXX
   ,T

   text

   #### = 0000 means normal, 0001 means censored, 0003 means scribbled
   **** is the author's uid, and login is the author's login
   fullname is the author's full name (or pseudonym) in this conference
   XXXXXXXX is the time entered, in hex format
   If a line of text needs to begin with a ",", then the comma is doubled.
