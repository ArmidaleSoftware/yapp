Description: Commands such as check and next use a list of conferences
   specified by the user.  This file allows a user to save a list of
   commonly accessed conferences.  It contains a list of conference names
   separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, or newlines).  Any lines
   beginning with a "#" character are interpreted as comments, and
   ignored.
