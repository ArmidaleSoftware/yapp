Description: Miscellaneous separators apply in all cases for all separator
   variables.  For any codes which use a number, the number defaults to 0
   unless otherwise stated.  A code is specified with: %Z#X
      where Z is an optional 'Z' or 'z' meaning print 'No' or 'no' in place of 0
            # is an optional number
            X is some character below.
