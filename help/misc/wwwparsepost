Syntax: www_parsepost [-c]

Description: This will read input from a WWW POST, and set the variables 
   indicated in the body accordingly.  If any variable already exists, 
   the new value is appended.  This allows posting lists from checkbox,
   select, etc.  When the -c option is specified, newlines inside values
   will be converted to 2 characters ("\n").
