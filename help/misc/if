Syntax: if (icon operator icon) 
        ... 
        else
        ...
        endif

Description: Allow conditional execution of commands according to some
   criteria.  An 'icon' can be the name of a variable (NOT inside the
   usual %{...} syntax), or an integer or string constant.  The else 
   section is, of course, optional.  Operators can be any of the normal 
   comparison relations: = (or ==), != (or <>), <, <=, >, or >=, as
   well as the list containment relations: ~ and !~ (read "contains" 
   and "does not contain").  Currently AND/OR criteria are not supported, 
   but if statements may be nested.

Examples:

   if (foo!="")
      echo ERROR: %{foo}
   endif

   if (nextitem > 0)
      new
   endif
