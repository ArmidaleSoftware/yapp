Syntax: ec_ho <string>
        echoe <string>
        echon <string>
        echone <string>
        echoen <string>

Description: These commands all display a string of text, and are useful
   for generating messages from batch files.  The echoe, echone, and echoen
   send the string to standard error rather than standard output.  The
   echon, echone, and echoen forms suppress advancing to a new line after
   printing string.
