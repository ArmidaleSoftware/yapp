        newuser <login> <password> [<password2> ['<fullname>' ['<email>' 
                        ['<varlist>']]]

Description: Only usable by the "nobody" account, this command allows
   creation of a local Yapp account.  Any optional fields will be
   prompted for if missing.  The first form of the command simply tests
   whether a given login is already in use.  The second form actually
   creates a new account.  If specified, 'varlist' is a list of Yapp 
   variables to save to the user's Yapp information database.
