        def_ine <variable> <string>          - assigns a value to a variable
        def_ine <variable> <type> <string>   - assigns a type and value
        const_ant <variable> <string>        - fixes a value for a variable
        const_ant <variable> <type> <string> - fixes a type and value 

Description: The commands def_ine, al_ias, undef_ine, and unal_ias are 
   all synonyms.  With no arguments, they display all currently
   defined macros.  With one argument, the specified macro is deleted.
   With two or three arguments, a new macro is created or an existing
   one changed, where <type> is an integer sum of the following:

      1 Command accessible from the Ok: prompt
      2 Variable
      4 Range macro
      8 Command accessible from the Respond or pass? prompt
     16 (unused)
     32 (unused)
     64 A macro defined by the global Yapp rc file
    128 A macro defined by the conference rc file
    256 Exported to shell environment

   For the two argument syntax, the default type is 2.

   The const_ant command does the same as define, except that the variable
   cannot later be redefined or undefined.
