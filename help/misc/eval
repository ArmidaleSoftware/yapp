Syntax: eval_uate [[<range>] "sepstring"]
        evali_n <range>

Description: If a range is specified, the separator string specified
   will be expanded as an itemsep for each item in the range.  
   Otherwise, the sepstring will be expanded once as a confsep.

   Note that normal separators (starting with a %) are expanded recursively
   until a % no longer appears.  You can use the format ${variable} in
   place of %{variable} to force single expansion.

   If no sepstring or range is given, text will be read from the input.
   The second form, evalin, is used to evaluate inputted text from with a
   range.  Input may be redirected using < or <<.

   A useful construct is combining the eval command with a << EOM
   redirection.  This will allow sending multiple lines of text through
   eval.

   Example:
   
   eval << DONE
   Here's some text
   pid=${pid}
   DONE
